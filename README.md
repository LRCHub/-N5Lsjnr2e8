[00:12.30] You show me love then spit in my face
[00:16.21] Making your money off all of my pain
[00:19.92] You put an eagle inside of a cage
[00:23.73] And you think I'm not strong enough to escape
[00:46.23] 
[00:27.19] But I refuse to let you make me feel like I can't fly
[00:34.58] Not only will I soar again, I'll own the fucking sky, yeah
[01:03.58] 
[00:43.67] So I put my middle finger up
[00:47.65] I'm done being your slave
[00:51.50] My generation's had enough
[00:55.33] And you should be afraid
[00:57.64] Oh-whoa, oh, not your prisoner
[01:01.16] Oh-whoa, oh, better listen when I say
[01:06.59] I put my middle finger up
[01:10.38] I'm done being your slave
[01:22.88] 
[01:20.00] You couldn't even look me in the eye
[01:23.79] When you let me go and then left me to die
[01:27.36] There was no question that I would survive
[01:31.14] An artist on fire is one that's alive
[01:49.64] 
[01:34.99] You can't surround a lion with a bunch of lazy sheep
[01:41.89] The one thing about royalty is that we love to feast, yeah
[02:10.89] 
[01:51.13] So I put my middle finger up
[01:55.40] I'm done being your slave
[01:59.16] My generation's had enough
[02:03.29] And you should be afraid
[02:05.17] Oh-whoa, oh, not your prisoner
[02:08.79] Oh-whoa, oh, better listen when I say
[02:14.24] I put my middle finger up
[02:17.80] I'm done being your slave
[02:30.30] 
[02:34.31] Living like a riot
[02:36.09] Setting off the sirens
[02:37.92] Fists are clenched, I'm fighting
[02:39.82] Soul has been ignited
[02:41.61] Ain't got time for dyin'
[02:43.34] I'm too busy thrivin'
[02:45.35] More than just survivin'
[02:47.10] Heart is beating violent
[02:59.10] 
[02:49.22] Living like a riot
[02:51.12] Setting off the sirens
[02:52.95] Fists are clenched, I'm fighting
[02:54.82] Soul has been ignited
[02:56.76] Ain't got time for dyin'
[02:58.40] I'm too busy thrivin'
[03:00.29] More than just survivin'
[03:02.15] Heart is beating violent
[03:14.15] 
[03:05.88] So I put my middle finger up
[03:10.29] I'm done being your slave
[03:14.15] My generation's had enough
[03:17.84] And you should be afraid
[03:20.14] Oh-whoa, oh, not your prisoner
[03:23.64] Oh-whoa, oh, better listen when I say
[03:29.14] I put my middle finger up
[03:32.88] I'm done being your slave
