Once I enjoyed your company
And all the perks it brings
Crowns and jewels and flattery
Dining with the kings
Starring as your favorite singer
Before we say goodbye
Can you see a middle finger
Rising to the sky?
Pills and grass and booze and ass
All just for a song
Lay another golden egg
Or all of it is gone
A foot in the grave and here we linger
Before you say goodbye
Can you see a middle finger?
Look up at the building
Can't you see it's burning
The end of a golden age
Goodbye to the golden cage
You say my day has come and gone
You're closing down the store
Boards and nails you hammer on
My heart is on the floor
A foot in the grave and digging deeper
Before we say goodbye
Can you see my middle finger?
